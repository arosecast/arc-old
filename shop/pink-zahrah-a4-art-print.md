<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
With a name meaning 'star', pink haired Zahrah has such a love for astronomy that she has had constellations and the phases of the moon tattooed onto her skin. As well as releasing this illustration as a print, I have turned it into a piece of rose gold necklace with a printed walnut wood pendant. 

This illustration is also available as an [illustrated rose gold and wooden pendant necklace](/shop/zahrah-constellation-moon-phase-tattoo-necklace.html) and an [A6 art print]().
