<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
With a name meaning 'Guardian of the Sea', Meredith is a blue haired, ocean and cupcake loving girl who likes to accessorise with anchor necklaces and striped breton tops. As well as releasing this illustration as a print, I have turned it into a piece of rose gold necklace with a printed walnut wood pendant. 

This illustration is also available as an [illustrated rose gold and wooden pendant necklace]() and an [A6 art print]().
