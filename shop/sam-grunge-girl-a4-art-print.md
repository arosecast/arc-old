<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
Sam is a messy haired, grunge loving girl from the early 1990s. She loves few things more than her trusty plaid flannel shirt, her Smashing Pumpkins 'Zero' t-shirt, and a pair of DMs. You can often find her sitting on a Brooklyn brownstone listening to some of her favourite Seattle-based bands. 

This illustration is also available as an [illustrated rose gold and wooden pendant necklace](/shop/sam-grunge-girl-necklace.html) and an [A6 art print]().
