<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
An ode to all cat ladies out there. This watercolour illustration of a pink-haired, crazy cat lady and her three kitties was inspired by my three cats, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_bgRcIGFT7/" title="A photo of Mog on my Instagram">Mog</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8nSfiJmFWm/" title="A photo of Toby on my Instagram">Toby</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_JysW9GFdo/" title="A photo of Month on my Instagram">Monty</a>. This wooden brooch is the perfect way for all cat-lovers out there to jazz up a jacket, cardigan or dress with some feline goodness.
