<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
<p>Sam is a messy haired, grunge loving girl from the early 1990s. She loves few things more than her trusty plaid flannel shirt, her Smashing Pumpkins 'Zero' t-shirt, and a pair of DMs. You can often find her sitting on a Brooklyn brownstone listening to some of her favourite Seattle-based bands.</p>

This illustration is also available as an [A4]() and an [A6]() art print.
