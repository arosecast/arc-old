<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
A watercolour and pencil illustration for the Haruki Murakami novel, 'Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage'. Tsukuru Tazaki had four best friends at school. By chance all of their names contained a colour. The two boys were called Akamatsu, meaning ‘red pine’, and Oumi, ‘blue sea’, while the girls’ names were Shirane, ‘white root’, and Kurono, ‘black field’. Tazaki was the only last name with no colour in it. One day Tsukuru Tazaki’s friends announced that they didn't want to see him, or talk to him, ever again.

This illustration is also available as an [A6 art print]().
