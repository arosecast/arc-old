<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
A watercolour and pencil illustration for the Haruki Murakami novel, 'Kafka on the Shore'. Comprising two distinct but interrelated plots, the narrative runs back and forth between both plots, taking up each plotline in alternating chapters. In one, teenage Kafka runs away from his father's house to escape an Oedipal curse and to embark upon a quest to find his mother and sister. In the other, Nagata's ability to speak to cats puts him on a path that ultimately takes him far away from his home, ending up on the road for the first time in his life.

This illustration is also available as an [A6 art print]().
