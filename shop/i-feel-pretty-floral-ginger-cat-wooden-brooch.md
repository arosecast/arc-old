<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
A ginger Norwegian Forest cat surrounded in flowers and other floral elements, with calligraphy lettering below, spelling out &quot;I Feel Pretty&quot;. This watercolour illustration is based on my own cat, [Toby](https://www.instagram.com/p/8nSfiJmFWm/), and this wooden brooch is the perfect way for all cat-lovers out there to jazz up a jacket, cardigan or dress with some feline goodness.

This illustration is also available as an [illustrated rose gold and wooden pendant necklace](/shop/i-feel-pretty-floral-ginger-cat-necklace.html)
