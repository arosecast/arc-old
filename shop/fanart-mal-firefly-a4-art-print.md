<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
A watercolour and pencil fan art illustration of the captain of the Serenity, Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds, from Joss Whedon's sadly shortlived sci-fi western, Firefly. &quot;I aim to misbehave.&quot;

This illustration is also available as an [A6 art print]() and a [greeting card](/shop/fanart-mal-firefly-greeting-card.html).
