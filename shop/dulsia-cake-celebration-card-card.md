<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
With a name meaning &quot;sweet&quot;, Dulsia loves nothing more than filling herself up with beautiful cakes. With her blonde and pink ombre hair, here she sits eating her rainbow layer cake, topped with buttercream frosting/icing and plump strawberries, with an ornate dessert fork. With the lettering below, spelling out &quot;All the Cake&quot;, this greeting card is perfect for any celebration or birthday.
