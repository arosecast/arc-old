<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
Named for the Roman Goddess of Wisdom, she is your modern geek girl. She watches Star Trek TNG and Buffy repeats, while boning up on medieval history. She knows ombre hair probably isnâ€™t quite as fashionable as it once was, but prefers to follow her own personal style than what happens to be in vogue at any particular time. Her glasses always have to have a bit of a vintage vibe to them.

Also avaiable as a [Congratulations greeting card](/shop/minerva-nerd-in-vintage-glasses-congratulations-card.html).
