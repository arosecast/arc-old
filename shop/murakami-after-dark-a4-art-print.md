<h2>About the Illustration</h2>
A watercolour and pencil illustration for the Haruki Murakami novel, 'After Dark', all about alienation, set over the course of one night after two of its principle characters meet at a Denny’s diner. Mari Asai, a 19-year-old student, is spending the night reading in a Denny’s. There she meets Takahashi Tetsuya, a trombone-playing student who loves Curtis Fuller’s “Five Spot After Dark” song on Blues-ette; Takahashi knows Mari’s sister Eri, who he was once interested in, and insists that the group of them have hung out before. Meanwhile, Eri is in a deep sleep next to a television and seems to be haunted by a menacing figure.
