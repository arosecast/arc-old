<p class="intro">Following other illustrators on Instagram is one of many ways I keep inspired with my work. Here are a few of my favourites.</p>

		<p>Maori Sakai creates simple pencil and sparsely coloured illustrations and animations. I love her uncluttered style, and how effectively a little bit of animation can bring life to her work.</p>
