<p class="intro">A lot of my work over the past little while has been a bit more behind the scenes (to be released over the next few months), so some of the 'new' things I've released have been older work.</p>

I'm also playing around with what I post here on the blog, introducing a new [Friday Faves](/category/friday-favourites/) column, and making [Loved Links](/category/loved-links/), [Creative Spotlight](/category/creative-spotlight/) and [Wish List](/category/wish-list/) a little less regular. I'm hoping that over the next few months, I'll be posting more of my own content here (not just products), but for now, onto what June and July has meant for me.

Other Happenings This Month
---
+ <strong>Reading</strong> // [The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13486632-the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared)
by Jonas Jonasson. I picked up this one when I was at Daunt Books ([sooooo pretty!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCIh81AmFfy/)) back in February, and I'm loving it. Though I've made slow progress as I just don't seem to be making enough time to read this month *sigh* ([Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1680658-karen-murray))
+ <strong>Watching</strong> // Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. It's a Tiny Fey show, so a must watch for me. I think it took me a few episodes to get into, but now I'm really loving it. I'm so happy Carol Kane plays such a big part as she was one of the first kooky personalities on TV and film I connected to as a kid in the 80s. And that intro is too damn catchy.
+ <strong>Listening</strong> // Nothing new this month! But I've gone back to listening to some of my fave Japanese artists, such as folk rock singer [Cocco](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTc1NjA0ODk2.html) ([Official English Site](http://www.cocco.co.jp/english/)).
+ <strong>Playing</strong> // I really need to get started on a new game &hellip;
+ <strong>Eating</strong> // Trying to get myself to like natto. If you know anything about this food, you'll understand.
+ <strong>Learning</strong> // Yoga, in order to focus on strength and balance.
+ <strong>Doing</strong> // Creating a proper shop for this site! Hopefully this will be live soon.
