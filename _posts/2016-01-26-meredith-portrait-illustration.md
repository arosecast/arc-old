I've a new one of my girls finished off and up on my stores. This blue-haired woman is Meredith. With a name meaning 'Guardian of the Sea', she is an ocean and cupcake loving girl who likes to accessorise with anchor necklaces and striped breton tops.

Iâ€™m delighted with how she has come out. I love the big curls in her hair, and the way the red, blue and turquoise colours play with one another. I seem to really enjoy adding [cakes](/project/illustration-greetinggirls.html "Greeting Cards featuring four different lovely ladies, including Dulsia and her rainbow cake") to my pieces; must be as I have a big sweet tooth! She has a very cute expression, licking her lips in anticipation of eating her flag-adorned cupcake.

Like most of my pieces, I have Meredith up as an [A4](https://www.etsy.com/listing/257820515/meredith-a4-print-of-a-pencil) and [A6 / postcard](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267621317/watercolor-portrait-illustration-a6) print (see above) over on my Etsy store. Both are printed digitally on gorgeous soft silk paper (love the texture of this stuff); the A4s have a weight of 250gsm, whereas the A6 are of 300gsm, giving a nice thickness to each print. And I've used her on a whole range of items on my [Society6](https://society6.com/product/nautical-fan-meredith-eating-a-cupcake_print#1=45) store; pillows, phone covers, mugs, you name it, she's on them.

And just like my previous girl, [Zahrah](/my-work/2015/12/08/zahrah-portrait-illustration.html "Pink-Haired Astronomy Lover Zahrah"), and my first release from my cat-themed product line, Wild Sofa Beasts, ['I Feel Pretty'](/my-work/2016/01/12/i-feel-pretty-ginger-cat.html "I Feel Pretty - Wooden Brooch of a Ginger Cat with Flowers and Calligraphy Quote by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast"), I've also turned her into a piece of jewellery! Using a chain and fastenings in a rose gold colour, teamed with a printed walnut wood pendant (produced by [Zap! Creatives](http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk)), I hand assembled these necklaces. I even joined a little light blue bead to each to add a little more sparkle to the piece (I think it brings out the blue of her hair). After years of making a few pieces of jewellery for myself and friends, it's nice to create something adorned with my own artwork.
