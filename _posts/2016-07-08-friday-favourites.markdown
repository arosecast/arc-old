		<p>I love DIYs that help elevate a simple present into something much more special. And when it's cat-themed, that just makes it even better.</p>

		<p>Such a lovely and simple water garden using a nice jar, aquarium stones/pebbles and a few aquatic plants. Think I'll make one of these for my office (when I get around to sorting my shelving out!)</p>
