I've started doing a few flashbacks posts talking about some of my favourite pieces from my back-catalogue; first up was my fan art illustration of [Willow Rosenberg](/my-work/2016/05/16/fanart-willow-rosenberg-buffy.html) from Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer; then I shared [Captain Jean-Luc Picard](/my-work/2016/06/13/fanart-captain-picard-star-trek-tng.html) from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Today, it's all about another fan art piece, this time of Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds of Joss Whedon's classic sci-fi/western Firefly.

I'm a big nerd; you can see that from [a number of](/wish-list/2016/04/21/6-adorable-brooches-pins-from-independent-makers.html "Wish List // 6 Adorable Brooches and Pins from Independent Makers") my [wish list posts](/wish-list/2016/02/25/6-nerdy-creations-by-independent-artists.html "Wish List // 6 Nerdy Creations by Independent Artists"). I came to Firefly a little late. I had heard about it around the time it was first released, but knowing it had been suddenly cancelled, I didn't look too much into it. A few years later, its popularity had exploded, especially with the release of the movie. So I rented the first DVD to check it out. I don't think I got around to renting the second DVD as I went straight to buying the box set.

It’s an immense shame to see such a great show cut down just when it had barely begun. But despite having only 14 episodes and a movie, it is one of the most respected sci-fi shows of the past few decades due to its mixing of varied genres, flawed characters and stellar writing.

So I felt I should do a little ode to the show and one of its greatest characters, Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds, brilliantly portrayed by Nathan Fillion. And just like [Willow](/my-work/2016/05/16/fanart-willow-rosenberg-buffy.html) and [Picard](/my-work/2016/06/13/fanart-captain-picard-star-trek-tng.html), I was really ecstatic with how he turned out.
