<p class="intro">As <a href="/" title="A Rose Cast Porfolio">my work</a> is primarily created using watercolours, I'm always looking for other artists who work within the same medium to glean new ideas and find inspiration. Here are a few who have captured my attention recently.</p>

If you are a fan of either David Bowie or Lady Gaga, I am sure you've come upon Helen Green's illustration work before. She focuses on portraiture, particularly related to the music and fashion industries; her <a href="http://helengreenillustration.com/Time-May-Change-Me" title="David Bowie Time May Change Me animation on Helen Green’s website">David Bowie career-spanning time lapse animation</a> is a sight to see and especially poignant this week. Her style is wonderfully unique; despite its realistic appearance, you can always tell her pieces from other watercolour artists. I also love her pattern illustration designs, such as these ones of <a href="http://helengreenillustration.com/Red-Dwarf-Patterns" title="Red Dwarf Watercolor Pattern Illustration on Helen Green’s website">Red Dwarf</a> and <a href="http://helengreenillustration.com/Duran-Duran-Paper-Gods" title="Duran Duran, Paper Gods Watercolor Pattern Illustration on Helen Green’s website">Duran Duran</a>.

Cats and watercolour: always a pleasing combination in my mind. A lifelong cat lover, Megan Lynn Kott is not only an amazing watercolour illustrator, but has an often subversive sense of humour that makes her pieces standout. She has worked with clients including Old Navy, Chronicle Books, Gymboree, and Tea Collection, and has realised a book full of temporary cat tattoos, aptly named <a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/titles/cattoos.html" title="Megan Lynn Kott's temporary tattoo cat book, Cattoos! on Chronicle Books">Cattoos!</a>.

Marion Bolognesi creates expressive, abstract portraiture where the eyes truely are the window to the soul. I love how free she is with her painting; not only are the facial features so lifelike, but they are melded with gorgeous spots and splashes of intense colour.
