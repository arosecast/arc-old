<p class="intro">I've now released a few little pieces of  <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18187909" title="Illustrated jewellery on A Rose Cast's Etsy store">illustrated jewellery</a>. I have two <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/257926790/rose-gold-walnut-wood-pendant-necklace" title="Illustrated jewellery on A Rose Cast's Etsy store">rose gold</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/257821751/rose-gold-walnut-wood-pendant-necklace" title="Illustrated jewellery on A Rose Cast's Etsy store">walnut wood</a> portrait pendant necklaces, and a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/257820045/walnut-wood-brooch-with-illustration-of" title="Illustrated jewellery on A Rose Cast's Etsy store">cat and flower themed brooch</a>.</p>

Today I'm adding another cute cat brooch; an ode to all the crazy cat ladies out there (like myself).

This was actually the first piece I designed for a non-print product, and it inspired me to create the <a href="/tag/Wild-Sofa-Beasts/" title="See Other Wild Sofa Beasts Products">Wild Sofa Beasts</a> product line. This piece includes all of my three cats, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_bgRcIGFT7/" title="A photo of Mog on my Instagram">Mog</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8nSfiJmFWm/" title="A photo of Toby on my Instagram">Toby</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_JysW9GFdo/" title="A photo of Month on my Instagram">Monty</a>. As with almost all of my pieces, this was painted in watercolour, but this time watercolour was used for the black outer lines as well, instead of my normal pencil.

Soon <em>Wild Sofa Beasts</em> will not solely be comprised of wooden brooches. I'm hoping to not only create cat-themed prints, brooches and other pieces of jewellery under this label, but also stickers, stationery and maybe eventually patterned fabric.

The last of my finished cat-themed wooden brooches, <a href="/project/illustration-wild-sofa-beasts.html" title="See the other cat-themed wooden brooches, the last if which is due to be released soon">a book-themed one</a>, can be seen over on my portfolio and will be released very soon. And I'm currently working on more brooches, including one for all you dog lovers out there.
