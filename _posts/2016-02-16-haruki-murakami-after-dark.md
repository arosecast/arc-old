<p class="intro">Another month, another one of my Haruki Murakami illustrations. This time it is of After Dark, a novel all about alienation, set over the course of one night after two of its principle characters meet at a Denny’s diner.</p>

I really feel the need to go back and reread this novel. I remember really enjoying it at the time, but - though I can recall the rough storyline - all of the details and the feelings I felt at the time elude me. It’s pretty short as Murakami goes, and I think I finished it in a few hours (perhaps why I don’t remember it as well as most of his other novels). So maybe I should have another go after I finally get around to reading Wind/Pinball?

As I've mentioned before when sharing my other [Haruki Murakami illustrations](/tag/Haruki-Murakami/ "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Novels"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So here is my new version of the illustration for Murakami’s novel, After Dark. Despite my poor memory of the book, I'm really delighted with how this illustration turned out. I worried that the vivid yellow, green and red of the Denny’s brand wouldn’t make a pretty picture, but nope, they look good! The night sky looks nice and ominous, and the windows hit at what is happening behind those panes of glass. This is definitely one of my favourite of my Murakami illustrations.

As normal, I have released it as an A6 and A4 print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/268409209/haruki-murakamis-after-dark-a4 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's After Dark on Esty") store, as well as a range of products over on [Society6](https://society6.com/product/haruki-murakamis-after-dark_print#1=45 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's After Dark on Society6").
