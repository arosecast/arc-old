<p class="intro">A few weeks ago I released my first pieces of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18187909" title="Illustrated jewellery on A Rose Cast's Etsy store">illustrated jewellery</a>; two rose gold and walnut wood pendant necklaces. And today I'm adding this cat-themed wooden brooch to my product line.

This piece is based on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8nSfiJmFWm/" title="Toby on A Rose Cast's Instagram">Toby</a>, my rather handsome part-Norwegian Forest ginger tom cat. It's a bit of a thing at the moment, portraits of animals and people surrounded by flowers, so I thought I'd try my hand at a slightly tongue-in-cheek version of this. As with almost all of my pieces, this was painted in watercolour, but this time watercolour was used for the black outer lines as well, instead of my normal pencil.

'I Feel Pretty' is the first of a product line I've started called '<strong><em>Wild Sofa Beasts</em></strong>'. I'm hoping to not only create cat-themed prints, brooches and other pieces of jewellery under this label, but also stickers, stationery and maybe eventually patterned fabric.

You can have a sneak peek at the other two finished <a href="/project/illustration-wild-sofa-beasts.html" title="See the other cat-themed wooden brooches, due to be released over the next few months">cat-themed wooden brooches</a> over on my portfolio, (which include my other two cats <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/5wHS6TGFTD/" title="Mog and Monty on A Rose Cast's Instagram">Mog and Monty</a>). For now, 'I Feel Pretty' is the only one available to purchase, but I'm hoping to add a new one every month to my online stores.
