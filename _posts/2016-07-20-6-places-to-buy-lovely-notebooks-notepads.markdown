<p class="intro">Who else is a stationery addict? I have so many notebooks, but still lust after buying even more. I should actually just sit down and use the ones I have so I can occasionally treat myself to a replacement, but I always have a hard time marking their pretty pages.</p>

Here are a few of my favourites notebooks at the moment. These wonderful designers and illustrators are inspiring me to design a <a href="/category/my-work/" title="Illustration and Design Products from A Rose Cast">few notebooks for my own products</a>.

		<p>I have a hard time not including <a href="/tag/cats/" title="Other Blog Posts Featuring Cats">cats somewhere in my posts</a>. I've loved the stuff produced by Toby of ilikecats for a long time, and these notebooks are no exception.</p>

		<p>I'm a massive Wes Anderson fan, and when The Grand Budapest Hotel came out, it felt like he had made a movie that gathered all my greatest loves together into one celluloid dream. So I would love this little notebook to carry around.</p>

		<p>These quaint illustrated notepads and to-do lists from Quill and Fox come in a few different themes, from flowers and plants, to animals and this little book club version. They all evoke a welcome sense of nostalgia and a quiet softness.</p>

		<p>One of many ways to make me lust after a product is to give a library theme. This deskplanner, with illustrations of a globe, books and indoor plants, is adorable. Itâ€™s sized to sit on your desk, and, with 52 sheets, it helps you plan the whole year out (<a href="/freebie/2016/05/30/vintage-glasses-weekly-planner-june-freebie.html" title="Donwload the Vintage Glasses Weekly Planner">like my vintage glasses weekly planner.</a>)</p>
