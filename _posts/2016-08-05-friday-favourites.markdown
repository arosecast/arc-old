<p class="intro">A few little things I've come across this week that I'm loving.</p>

<div class="row">

		<p>Cats and feminism are always a winning combination for me. This cat wants equality right meow. Show her off on your jacket, bag or hat.</p>

		<p>And another mix of feline cuteness and equality politics. I actually treated myself to this enamel pin a few weeks back.</p>

		<p>It’s been two years now since I visited New York and I’m hoping to head back again at some point in the future. So having a fun list of places to go and eat is always a good thing.</p>

		<p>I’m not very adventurous when it comes to make-up, so would love to try out a few of these playful styles on a night out. Or maybe even use them on a few of my <a href="/tag/portrait/" title="Watercolour Illustrations of Modern Girls">illustrated girls</a>.</p>

		<p>I love Asian desserts, so the thought of ice cream with sesame and taro sounds great to me. I haven’t made ice cream at all this summer, so should probably give this a try.</p>
