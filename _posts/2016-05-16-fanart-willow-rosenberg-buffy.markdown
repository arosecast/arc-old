Before I release a few new pieces, I wanted to do a flashback to one of my favourite pieces from my back-catalogue, and one of my all-time bestsellers.

It shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone, from [some of](/wish-list/2016/04/21/6-adorable-brooches-pins-from-independent-makers.html "Wish List // 6 Adorable Brooches and Pins from Independent Makers") my [wish list posts](/wish-list/2016/02/25/6-nerdy-creations-by-independent-artists.html "Wish List // 6 Nerdy Creations by Independent Artists"), that I’m more than a little bit of a nerd.

A while back, as a way to practice drawing real-life people, I thought it would be fun to create a few fan art pieces. One of the first people I decided to draw was Willow Rosenberg from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. As someone who was a teenager in the late 90s and early 00s (I was around two years younger than the characters were), Buffy was one of the biggest shows of my youth, and I still love to watch it. Willow is probably the most popular character from the show, so she seemed to be the perfect candidate.

The practice worked out so well that I decided to pop [A4](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210512307/fan-art-willow-rosenberg-of-joss-whedons "A4 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Willow Rosenberg, from Joss Whedon's supernatural TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") and [A6](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267723374/fan-art-postcards-choose-from-picard "A6 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Willow Rosenberg, from Joss Whedon's supernatural TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") art prints up on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast), along with a [greeting card version with an additional banner of text](https://www.etsy.com/listing/213514369/fan-art-greeting-cards-select-who-you "Greeting Card of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Willow Rosenberg, from Joss Whedon's supernatural TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;"). Rather than just any old phrase, I thought it would be nice to match the lettering to Willow herself. As she is an eternal Buffy supporter, I though it would be nice to style this card as something you could give to a friend to tell them you’ll always be there to support them.

And so far this little practice-turned-product has worked so well on my stores. So much so that I decided to continue on and create a little [fan art line of art prints and greeting cards](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=16232976) to go along with her. Currently she is joined by; fellow Joss Whedon creation [Malcolm ‘Mal’ Reynolds](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209540430/fan-art-malcolm-mal-reynolds-of-joss) from the short-lived sci-fi/western classic Firefly; [Captain Jean-Luc Picard](https://www.etsy.com/listing/211433813/fan-art-captain-jean-luc-picard-of-the) from the epic Star Trek: The Next Generation (my all-time favourite show as a kid); Usagi Tsukino from the manga/anime [Sailor Moon](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208694619/fan-art-tsukino-usagi-sailor-moon-a4); and [Princess Bubblegum](https://www.etsy.com/listing/257921802/fan-art-princess-bubblegum-from) from the animated show Adventure Time (though she still needs the greeting card treatment).
