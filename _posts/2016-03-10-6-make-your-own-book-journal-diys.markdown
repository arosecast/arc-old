<p class="intro">I’m a massive book nerd. I think one of the best ways to decorate a room is with tombs containing your favourite stories. I’ve even used my love of literature to inspire my art work before, with my <a href="/tag/haruki-murakami/" title="Blog posts for my watercolour illustrations for each of Haruki Murakami’s novels">watercolour illustrations for each of Haruki Murakami’s novels</a>.</p>

I also enjoy journalling. With everything happening in my life, both in work and outside of it, if I don’t have checklists and records, I’d be sitting baffled as to what I was supposed to be doing.

So to that end, I’ve rounded up a few fun book and journal inspired DIYs for anyone else out there with my love of bound pieces of paper.

		<p>A lovely way to capture your photos and memories using your favourite piece of fabric. I adore the use of Chicago screws to bind these journals.</p>

		<p>I desperately need a new purse / handbag. I'd feel bad about destroying a book for the sole purpose of turning it into a bag, but it could turn out so pretty I think I could justify it. (Just don’t use anything rare!)</p>

		<p>Again, book destruction, but it looks so darn good. This time it’s for the perfect literary tech organiser. What better way to protect your gear than in an old hardback book?</p>
