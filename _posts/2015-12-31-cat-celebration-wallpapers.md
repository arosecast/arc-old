<p class="intro">Today I have the first of many freebies I hope to share with you available for download. Each month I plan to upload a new freebie ~ sometimes wallpapers, other times printables.</p>

Last month it was a [printable tattoo-inspired Christmas garland](/freebie/2015/12/10/printable-tattoo-inspired-christmas-garland.html) I originally made several years ago. But for January 2016, it's something brand new.

I'm working on a line of products based around my cats called [Wild Sofa Beasts](/project/illustration-wild-sofa-beasts.html). The first of these will be released soon after I return from my Christmas and New Year holidays. And as (almost) everyone loves cats, what would be better than to share a fun little wallpaper adorned with some cute watercolour cat illustrations.

And as tomorrow it will be both January and 2016, a celebration theme suits perfect. So not only do you have the kitty faces wearing party hats (as apparently the 15th is National Hat Day), but also party poppers with confetti, honeycomb paper decorations, and boxes of popcorn (the 19th is Popcorn Day). Almost everything is pink and red, the traditional colours for the month of January.

So please download these digital wallpapers (there are two versions, vertical and horizontal) and dress up your tech to help celebrate the New Year.
