<p class="intro">Hi all! I have another fun little freebie for you. Planners really seem to be a thing at the moment, especially within my orbit of bloggers and creatives.</p>

![June Freebie - Glasses Pattern Weekly Planner &amp; Wallpapers by illustrator and designer A Rose Cast](/assets/blog/2016-05/vintage-glasses-pattern-weekly-planner-wallpaper01.jpg "June Freebie - Glasses Pattern Weekly Planner &amp; Wallpapers by illustrator and designer @arosecast")

When you have so much to do in daily life, keeping reminders in your head is of no productive help. You need to get them out, to let your mind relax and let it drift onto more important matters than remembering the 101 things you feel you need to get done. Purging all that from our heads onto paper is important.

And you might as well do so on something that is pleasing to the eye as well as useful.

So I’ve created a little weekly planner for you all to download. I loved drawing the big vintage-style glasses on [my portrait illustration Minerva](/my-work/2016/04/04/minerva-greeting-card-wooden-necklace.html), so I thought glasses would be a good theme. And I’ve wanted to try [my hand at a pattern](/tag/pattern/) for a while, so I thought &quot;why not give it a shot here&quot;; [my freebies](/category/freebie/) aren’t just a present for you, but a place where I can play about with ideas without wondering if they a sellable/marketable.

+ [Download the Vintage Glasses Desk Weekly Planner](/assets/blog/2016-05/vintage-glasses-weekly-planner.pdf)

And I’m really chuffed with the result. So much so that I’m not just giving away the printable weekly planner, but even created a few additional freebie wallpapers for you as well!
