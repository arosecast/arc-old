After releasing a number of cat-related products, I knew it was about time to give something to all you dog-lovers out there.

Cats may be my favourite animal, but I’m also a dog fan, especially of the larger dog breeds. (What I wouldn't give for a cuddle with a dog close to my own size?) One type of dog I’ve always been drawn to is the Shiba Inu, not just because they are so darn cute, but as for a long time I’ve known the famous story of Hachiko. I even took a photo with [his statue while visiting Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan last year](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFJ0WjLGFTB/).

So as a little ode to all of puppy-kind out there, the newest addition to my [wooden brooch line](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=18187909) is this watercolour illustration of a Shiba Inu dog.

A few of my brooches in the past have had a related calligraphy quote, so I search Goodreads to find something that would fit. When I came upon the Charles M. Schulz (of Peanuts fame) line “Happiness is a warm puppy”, I instantly thought my little Shiba would look adorable wrapped in a scarf.

As with my other [wooden jewellery](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=18187909), the artwork was created in watercolour, and the charms printed and laser cut by [Zap! Creatives](http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk). Each has a clasp attached to the back.

I really loved creating this guy, and am looking forward to adding a few new dog breeds to the list of brooches, as well as maybe a few other products (doggie greeting cards would prove popular, I have no doubt). I think my next one may be a husky or a samoyed; I have very fond memories of a family of huskies who lived near me as a child and if I had to have a dog, I think I would waver towards wolf-like breeds.

I do wonder how my cats would get on with one of them. [Toby](https://www.instagram.com/p/BE0lTYimFRT/) was brought up with dogs as a kitten so I think he would really love to have some canine friends once again. If you have a favourite dog that you would like immortalised, give me a shout over on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/arosecast), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/arosecast/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ARoseCast/).
