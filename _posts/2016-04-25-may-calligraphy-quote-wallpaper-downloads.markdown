<p class="intro">A lot of my self-focused pieces are inspired by things I'm loving at the moment. So when it came to creating this new wallpaper, I decided to use a saying used in a book I'm just a little bit enamoured with currently; <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus" title="The Night Circus by Erin Morganstern on Goodreads">The Night Circus by Erin Morganstern</a>.</p>

In the book, it's the English version of the family motto of one of the main characters, Celia Bowen (in the original latin it is &quot;Esse quam videri&quot;). But away from literature, it is actually [a well-know saying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esse_quam_videri "More about the saying, Esse quam videri"). So I felt that even those who havenâ€™t read the book would still enjoy the sentiment.

I've been wanting to create a few new pieces of calligraphy lettering for a while, so when I was hard-pressed to come up with a new [freebie](/category/freebie/ "See all of my freebies"), I decided that this was a good way to start. I thought something bound within a circle would work well for a digital wallpaper, so started sketching ideas on how to fit all the words within that shape.

After a number of attempts, I had something that worked well, and was able to get started on the painting. The piece was created with watercolour paint and then brought into Photoshop for some quick tidy-ups, to separate the letters from the paper, and to place them onto backgrounds of my branding colours.

What do you think of the photos? I'm slowly getting a bit better with product photography and styling. It's going to take a while before they are a little closer to being just what I want, but everything is a process. I just have to keep practicing!

So there we go. Go dress up your tech with some pretty calligraphy!
