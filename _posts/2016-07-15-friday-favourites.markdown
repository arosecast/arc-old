		<p>I’m a big lover of pastels, so runnerkimhall's Instagram account is a joy to follow. So many playful photos with beautiful pastel colourscapes. Plus, a stinkingly adorable dog!</p>

		<p>I met <a href="http://www.madebymrsm.co.uk">Kate</a> while I was in London for the <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/tag/blogtacular/">Blogtacular conference</a>. I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/449213280/custom-house-home-shop-business-building" title="Custom Home / Shop / Building Watercolor and Pencil Portrait Painting by A Rose Cast on Etsy">architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/462863291/belfast-buildings-a5-prints-of-pencil" title="Watercolour Portraits of Famous Belfast Buildings by A Rose Cast on Etsy">illustrated buildings</a>, so I really adore her products. To anyone who loves brutalist or mid-century design, I think you’ll find more than a few things to love on her shop and blog.</p>

		<p>I have my first stall at a <a href="http://love-your-home.uk">convention in Belfast</a> this October, so I’m looking for cheap but effective ways to display my products. I think these little mountain photo holders would look great on my table.</p>

		<p>I love these pieces of advice from artist and author Adam J. Kurtz for working creatives. I think finding your style is one of the hardest things facing creatives. I'm still at a point where I'm testing the waters of where I want A Rose Cast to go in terms of style and content, but I'm getting there! (I think &hellip;)</p>

		<p>Sponsor posts are becoming much more of a regular thing on blogs. Sometimes you can tell when they are forced; I find myself just quickly strolling by these. I love Keiko Lynn's take on them; even if you aren’t interested in the product featured or in the post topic, you can still get behind the whimsical photos. And, well, cute dogs are always a win, aren't they?</p>
