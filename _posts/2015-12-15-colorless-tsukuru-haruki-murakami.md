<p class="intro">I've been a Haruki Murakami fan for around 15 years now, after first becoming intrigued by the cover of The Elephant Vanishes while perusing a local bookstore.</p>

His novels have always captivated my imagination, and I consider him to be my favourite author. When I first started to get back into illustration, after 10 years away, I decided to do an <a href="http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami" title="The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations">illustration for each of his novels</a> in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop.

I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So to kick off the project, I have created an illustration for Murakami’s latest novel, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, and released it as an A6 and A4 print on my Easy store, as well as a range of products over on Society6.

You can also get a sneak peek at all the rest of my <a href="/project/illustration-murakami.html" title="Haruki Murakami novel watercolor illustrations by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast">Haruki Murakami novel illustrations</a> over on my portfolio. For now, Colorless Tsukuru is the only one available to purchase, but I'll be adding a new one every month to my online stores.
