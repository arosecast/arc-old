<p class="intro">And March is already upon us. Here in Northern Ireland, the month has started as it often does; sudden downpours of rain, snow and hale, powerful gusts of winds and blistering sunshine. So Spring is truly on the way.</p>

This month, I'm back to giving away a few wallpapers to all you good folk out there. Like my [celebration-themed wallpapers for January 2016](/freebie/2015/12/31/cat-celebration-wallpapers.html), these once again feature my three lovely cats, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_bgRcIGFT7/" title="A photo of Mog on my Instagram">Mog</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8nSfiJmFWm/" title="A photo of Toby on my Instagram">Toby</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_JysW9GFdo/" title="A photo of Month on my Instagram">Monty</a>.

But to go with the new month, I've added a little bit of St. Paddy's Day goodness to the mix in the form of a fair few shamrocks. And, yes, THREE leaves. I keep seeing people creating graphics for St. Patrick's Day with four leaves (and saying St. Patty's Day -_-). I can't remember ever seeing a four leaf clover representing Ireland here on the island of Ireland :D
