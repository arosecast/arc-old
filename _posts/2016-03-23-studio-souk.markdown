<p class="intro">As I’ve mentioned over on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arosecast/" title="A Rose Cast on Instagram">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/arosecast" title="A Rose Cast on Twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARoseCast/" title="A Rose Cast on Facebook">Facebook</a> pages, and on the <a href="/month-in-review/2016/03/01/month-in-review.html">blog earlier this month</a>, I am proud to announce that I have secured my first stockist; <a href="http://www.studiosouk.com" title="Visit the Studio Souk Website">Studio Souk</a>, in Belfast, Northern Ireland.</p>

Studio Souk was set up in 2013 by Linzi Rooney as a workplace where artists and designers could come together and create new work and sell their items to the public. Since its humble beginnings, it has been transformed from a small shop to a 6,000 sq. ft. city centre store showcasing over 80 local creatives. It not only helps small independent companies navigate the difficulties of running a business, but is also a registered charity that delivers innovative, community based art projects targeting young offenders and other young people.

It's long been one of my favourite places to visit in Belfast (I remember browsing the stalls at most of The Fashion Souk's markets), and was somewhere I dreamed of selling my creations; the store itself is a trove of amazing Northern Irish-made products. One day I plucked up the courage to send over an email with a link to my product catalogue, and was astonished when within a few days we were firming up plans for my launch.

Studio Souk stock almost all of the items currently available on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/arosecast), but they have a few exclusive products. If you are local to Belfast or Northern Ireland, you can buy these new products in-store. If not, don't worry; over the next few months all of these items will be popping up to buy online. So for now, here’s a few sneak peaks.
