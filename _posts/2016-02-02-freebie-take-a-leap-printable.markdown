<p class="intro">Last month I created some <a href="/freebie/2015/12/31/cat-celebration-wallpapers.html" title="January Freebie // Cat and Celebration Themed Digital Wallpapers">cat and celebration themed digital wallpapers</a> for you all. For this month's freebie, I decided to make an illustrated printable.</p>

As Leap Day only comes around once every four years, I thought I should take this opportunity to make something devoted to that rare day and the meaning behind it.

Writing down a goal or dream helps us move towards achieving it. So I thought why not create something pretty to use in this way? And this little freebie, with its leaping woman (her strawberry tights hint at 27th February being National Strawberry Day) and calligraphic lettering, was born.

All that is needed is a printer, some thick card stock (even paper is grand), and a pen.
 There are three different colour versions, so print out your favourite one (or, well, all of them), write down what big chance you want to take this month, and stick the card up on your fridge, pin board, or somewhere else in sight.

 Enjoy!
