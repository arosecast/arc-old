Hello, everyone. Meet Zahrah, my new girl. With a name meaning 'star', this pink-haired woman has such a love for astronomy that she has had constellations and the phases of the moon tattooed onto her skin. She may be very much a girly-girl, but that doesn't mean she's shy and docile; she has a cheeky streak, and never backs down when her beliefs are challenged.

I'm really proud of this piece; she is of my favourite pieces I've created since starting illustration. I think Zahrah excudes a very strong and playful personality in her look and stance. And I wish I had candy floss / cane coloured and shaped hair!

When creating her, I knew I wanted a nice deep yellow to be in there, but wasn't sure how it would go with the pastel pink. Surprisingly it's worked perfectly, and the teal-green colour in her dress balances it out and gives another interesting hint. I've often focused on two colours before in my art work, but I think three really maybe the key.

Like most of my pieces, I have Zahrah up as an <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/257821175/zahrah-a4-print-of-a-pencil-watercolour" title="A4 Art Print of Zahrah // Pencil &amp; Watercolour Portrait of a Pink-Haired Astronomy Lover (Star and Moon) on Etsy">A4</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/267621317/watercolor-portrait-illustration-a6" title="A6 / Postcard Art Print of Zahrah // Pencil &amp; Watercolour Portrait of a Pink-Haired Astronomy Lover (Star and Moon) on Etsy">A6 / postcard</a> print (see above) over on my Etsy store. Both are printed digitally on gorgeous soft silk paper (love the texture of this stuff); the A4s have a weight of 250gsm, whereas the A6 are of 300gsm, giving a nice thickness to each print. And I've used her on a whole range of items on my <a href="https://society6.com/product/astronomy-fan-zahrah-moon-and-star_print#1=45">Society6</a> store; pillows, phone covers, mugs, you name it, she's on them.

And for the first time ever, I have also turned her into a piece of jewellery! Using a chain and fastenings in a rose gold colour, teamed with a printed walnut wood pendant (produced by <a href="http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk">Zap! Creatives</a>), I hand-made these necklaces. I even joined a little light green bead to each to add a little more sparkle to the piece (I think it brings out the green of her dress). After years of making a few pieces of jewellery for myself and friends, it's nice to create something adorned with my own artwork.
