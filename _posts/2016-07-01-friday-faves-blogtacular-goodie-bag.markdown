<p class="intro">As I <a href="/freebie/2016/06/27/blogtacular-photowalk-notting-hill-pastel-house-wallpaper.html" title="Freebie // The Blogtacular Photowalk &amp; A Notting Hill Pastel House Wallpaper">mentioned earlier this week</a> when I shared a <a href="/category/freebie/" title="See all of A Rose Cast's Freebies">new freebie</a> with you all, I was recently in London for the <a href="http://blogtacular.com" title="Visit the Blogtacular Website">Blogtacular</a> conference, a get-together for bloggers and small businesses. Being an event that brings together so many creatives, the goodie bags are known to be rather epic. Well, after getting mine, I can certainly see why!</p>

So for this week's Friday Faves, I thought I'd take the time to show you the contents of my goodie bag. Everything here is by a small British creative business; so please give each and every one of the makers your love and add them onto your list of go-to places for when you need something a little special.
