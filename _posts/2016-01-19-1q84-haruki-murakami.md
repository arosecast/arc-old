<p class="intro">Another month, another one of my Haruki Murakami illustrations. This time it is of 1Q84, one of Murakami's many surreal novels.</p>

![Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84 by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast](/assets/folio/murakami/illustration-murakami-19q4.jpg "Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84 by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast")

1Q84 is Murakami's longest novel, originally released as three separate volumes. I tend to prefer his more surreal, so it was a delight for me to read, even though it did take me a fair amount of time to get through its almost 1000 pages.

As I mentioned last month, when I shared my illustration for [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](/my-work/2015/12/15/colorless-tsukuru-haruki-murakami.html "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice.

Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.
