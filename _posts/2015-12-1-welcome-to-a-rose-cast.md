<p class="intro">Welcome! Today, after a long time of planning, and more than a few hiccups along the way, <strong><em>A Rose Cast</em></strong> is born!</p>

I’ve actually been working towards this day for the last several years. I’ve been self-employed for almost six years now, and that whole time I’ve been working under my old name, Akaihane, something I came up with at 18 when I needed a website for my university portfolio. Yeah, Japanese words are difficult enough to pronounce, but when you add in the extra factor of a Northern Irish accent … I don’t know if I’ve ever had a client who can say it correctly!

So, fast-forward and after a year or two of trying to decide on a new name, I’ve finally arrived at the end! (At least I hope! I’m so bad at deciding upon things ;_;)

<strong><em>A Rose Cast</em></strong>, my little illustration and design business. You can find out more about me, Karen, over on the <a href="/about/">about page</a>, and most of my recent work is up over on the <a href="http://www.arosecast.com/">home page</a>, including a number of brand new pieces. I'm especially excited over how well my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18187909" title="View my jewellery pieces on sale on Etsy">new jewellery pieces have turned out</a>! My style is a kind of modern, Art-Nouveau inspired feminine look, created mostly in pencils and watercolour.

I sell illustrative goods, from prints and stationery, to jewellery and homewards, on my online stores and some physical shops (<a href="/work-with-me/">want to become one?</a>), and hope to expand my product range as things go along. I also work with clients on a wide range of fun illustration and design projects (<a href="/work-with-me/">get in contact</a> if you want to commission something from me).
