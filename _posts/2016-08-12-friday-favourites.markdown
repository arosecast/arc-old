		<p>Is this not the most genius way to style your products? I mean, just look at all the cute little British Shorthair kitty faces! Could I get my own little <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BH5GaJXjgn2/" title="Monty on A Rose Cast's Instagram">British Shorthair cat</a> to wear a collar? Could I get my cats to help me with product shots for my <a href="/tag/wild-sofa-beasts/" title="Wild Sofa Beasts Product Range by A Rose Cast">Wild Sofa Beasts</a> range?</p>

		<p>How amazing is this? I'm a massive Wes Anderson fan, and could definitely see myself making and playing this.  I love finding really inventive DIY projects like this, and love the character illustrations by <a href="http://haileynowak.me">Hailey Nowak</a>.</p>

		<p>Book shelf porn. There is little I like looking at more when it comes to homes than beautiful bookshelves. We have a massive amount of book shelves for a two-bedroom flat, but I do dream of having a house one day with a room full of built-in shelves like these.</p>
