<p class="intro">Anyone who has been reading my blog or following my work for even a short time will know that there are two things I love more than almost everything else; <a href="/tag/cats/" title="See all posts tagged cats">cats</a> and <a href="/tag/books/" title="See all posts tagged books">books</a>.</p>

I adore Edward Gorey, so when I came across a quote from him, &quot;Books. Cats. Life is good&quot;, I knew I wanted to use it in someway. Then I remembered that one of the [first photos I’d ever taken of our youngest cat, Monty](https://www.instagram.com/p/sGApATGFbe/), was of him ‘reading’ one of my Haruki Murakami’s novels ([I’m a big fan, if you hadn’t noticed](/tag/haruki-murakami/)). And these two things just sounded like they'd be perfect partners.

I broke out the pencils and watercolours and started trying to capture Monty’s cute blue spotted British Shorthair face; he has big jowls and is so full of chunky blobs that he really is a joy to draw. A little simple calligraphy lettering, a pair of nerdy glasses and a nice thick book, and I had an illustration that I was really chuffed with.

So, as I've done three times before with my [Wild Sofa Beasts](/tag/wild-sofa-beasts/) line of products, I've turned the watercolour drawing into a new wooden brooch. This piece also helps to expand on the [jewellery](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18187909) products I have up for sale on Etsy, and in-store at [Studio Souk](http://www.studiosouk.com) in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

If you are a cat and book lover like me, go and grab one of the brooches for yourself.
