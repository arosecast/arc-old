<p class="intro">I think if you asked any of my family or friends what my most loved thing in creation was, they would waste no time before saying cats.</p>

I love pretty much all animals, but these little feline rascals manage to push ahead of the pack, and something cat-related will always pop up in my Christmas and birthday presents. So here are a few of by favourite kitty-themed items created my independent artists.

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/256839530/avocatdo-soft-enamel-pin" title="Avocatdo Soft Enamel Pin by Pony People"><img src="/assets/blog/2016-01/avocatdo-soft-enamel-pin.jpg" alt="Avocatdo Soft Enamel Pin by Pony People" title="Avocatdo Soft Enamel Pin by Pony People"></a>
		<h2>1. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/256839530/avocatdo-soft-enamel-pin" title="Avocatdo Soft Enamel Pin by Pony People">Avocatdo Soft Enamel Pin</a></h2>
		<p>I love cats and I love avocado. So a pin that combines them both? Pony People has so many wonderful cat-related items, and I’m having a hard time choosing between them. But this one is maybe at the top of my list.</p>

		<h2>2. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/ilikeCATSshop">I Like CATS</a></h2>
		<p>Anything from the Etsy store I Like CATS, run by Toby, is worth a purchase. Pins, prints, t-shirts, tote bags ... the list goes on. Everything is equally adorable and cat themed.</p>

		<p>Another pin, but I couldn’t help myself. A tombstone all about cats. Perfect. And for all you dog owners out there, there is a <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/227721823/there-better-be-dogs-tombstone-soft" title="'There Better Be Dogs' Tombstone Enamel Pin">dog version</a> of this pin as well.</p>

		<p>Not cheap, but then the cat’s ears are adorned with diamonds, so you can’t really complain. If you’re looking for something a little more than fashion jewellery, then this delicate necklace is worth the money.</p>
