<p class="intro">Brooches and pins are a great way small creative designers can make something people will love without completely breaking the bank. I've made a number of <a href="/tag/brooch/" title="Wooden Brooches by A Rose Cast">wooden brooches</a> myself (usually adorned with cat faces), and here are a few my other independent makers that I love.</a></p>

		<p>I love rose gold (evident in my choice of metal for <a href="/tag/jewellery/" title="Rose Gold Necklaces by A Rose Cast">my necklaces</a>), and it makes this little pin just perfect. Even more perfect is the fact that 25&#37; of the profit of each pin goes to benefits young girls through art exploration.</p>
