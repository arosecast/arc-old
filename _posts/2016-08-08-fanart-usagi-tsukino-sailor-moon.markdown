![Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Usagi Tsukino from manga/anime Sailor Moon](/assets/folio/fanart/illustration-fanart-sailormoon.jpg "Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Usagi Tsukino from manga/anime Sailor Moon, by @arosecast")

I've started doing a few flashbacks posts talking about some of my favourite pieces from my back-catalogue; first up was my fan art illustration of [Willow Rosenberg](/my-work/2016/05/16/fanart-willow-rosenberg-buffy.html) from Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer; then [Captain Jean-Luc Picard](/my-work/2016/06/13/fanart-captain-picard-star-trek-tng.html) from Star Trek: The Next Generation. And lastly I shared [Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds](/my-work/2016/07/18/fanart-malcolm-reynolds-firefly.html) of classic sci-fi/western Firefly. Today, it's all about another fan art piece, this time of Usagi Tuskino from the manga/anime Sailor Moon.

I'm a big nerd; you can see that from [a number of](/wish-list/2016/04/21/6-adorable-brooches-pins-from-independent-makers.html "Wish List // 6 Adorable Brooches and Pins from Independent Makers") my [wish list posts](/wish-list/2016/02/25/6-nerdy-creations-by-independent-artists.html "Wish List // 6 Nerdy Creations by Independent Artists"). I’ve been a manga and anime fan since my early teens. Although my interest has waned a little in the past few years, it still has a big place in my heart.

One of the first shows that I adored was Sailor Moon; I may have been a fair bit older than the target market, but it is a lot of fun, and the uncut Japanese versions of both the manga and anime are far darker than it looks from the outside. (Though I have to admit I haven’t watched any of Sailor Moon Crystal yet &hellip;)

After starting with a few pieces of fan art based on live action series, I wanted to create my own version of an illustrated/animated character. Usagi-chan was an obvious choice for me as I knew her hair and pose would be a lot of fun to recreate. I also wanted to play around with backgrounds a little more, adding fun watercolour effects, and felt that as a star field would be perfect for Sailor Moon, this was the perfect time.

Just like [Willow](/my-work/2016/05/16/fanart-willow-rosenberg-buffy.html), [Picard](/my-work/2016/06/13/fanart-captain-picard-star-trek-tng.html), [Malcolm Reynolds](/my-work/2016/07/18/fanart-malcolm-reynolds-firefly.html) and [Princess Bubblegum](/my-work/2016/02/23/princess-bubblegum-adventure-time-fanart.html), I'm really ecstatic with how she has turned out.

So I decided to pop [A4](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208694619/fan-art-tsukino-usagi-sailor-moon-a4 "A4 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Usagi Tsukino from manga/anime Sailor Moon, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") and [A6](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267723374/fan-art-postcards-choose-from-picard "A6 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Usagi Tsukino from manga/anime Sailor Moon, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") art prints up on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast), along with a [greeting card version with an additional banner of text](https://www.etsy.com/listing/213514369/fan-art-greeting-cards-select-who-you "Greeting Card of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Usagi Tsukino from manga/anime Sailor Moon, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;"); &quot;You'll always be my hero&quot;. This is the perfect card to give to a friend who you've always admired and to whom you look up to.
