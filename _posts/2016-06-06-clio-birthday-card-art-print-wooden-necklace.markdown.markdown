It's been a little while since I've released a new one of my portrait girls or a piece of jewellery. So let's sort that out right now with my pink and blue-haired lady, Clio.

![Rose gold and wooden pendant necklace of Clio - Watercolour Illustration of a Pink and Blue Haired Girl with Stars by Karen Murray of A Rose Cast](/assets/folio/portraits/clio-pink-blue-hair-rose-gold-necklace.jpg "Rose gold and wooden pendant necklace of Clio - Watercolour Illustration of a Pink and Blue Haired Girl with Stars by Karen Murray of @arosecast")

So why the name Clio? Clio is derived from a Greek root word that means &quot;to celebrate&quot; or &quot;make famous&quot;, so I thought it fitted this striking woman, especially as she adorns a birthday card. Quite different from my last girl, geeky [Minerva](/my-work/2016/04/04/minerva-greeting-card-wooden-necklace.html), Clio is very much a fashionista. With her big pouting lips, and pink and blue streaked white blonde hair, she's the cool girl you see in the fanciest patisseries and cocktail bars.

Clio is the final of line of five necklaces (there will be more in the future, I am sure). Like my other girls [Zahrah](/my-work/2015/12/08/zahrah-portrait-illustration.html), [Meredith](/my-work/2016/01/26/meredith-portrait-illustration.html), [Sam](/my-work/2016/03/07/90s-grunge-girl-sam.html) and [Minerva](/my-work/2016/04/04/minerva-greeting-card-wooden-necklace.html), she has been hand-made from a wooden pendant printed with my original illustration and rose gold jewellery pieces. A little pink or blue glass bead adds an extra little bit of glam.

Clio isn’t just [available as a necklace](https://www.etsy.com/listing/399016083/rose-gold-walnut-wood-pendant-necklace). I’ve added a little calligraphy &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to the illustration to turn her into the [perfect birthday card](https://www.etsy.com/listing/288123381/portrait-greeting-cards-for-celebrations). You can get this version of my pink- and blue-haired girl over on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/listing/288123381/portrait-greeting-cards-for-celebrations), along with two other celebratory portraits (one of which includes cake!).

Both the necklace and greeting card are in avaiable from my physical stockist, [Studio Souk](/my-work/2016/03/24/studio-souk.html) in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In fact, thanks to this piece and Studio Souk, I made my debut at Belfast Fashion Week in March. [Linzi, the manager, wore the Clio necklace](https://www.instagram.com/p/BC3ohalmFTv/) as her wonderful store won two well-deserved awards at the event.
