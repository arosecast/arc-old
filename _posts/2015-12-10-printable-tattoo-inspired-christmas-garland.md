<p class="intro">Due to more than a few factors (relaunching my business, sickness and a long trip to Japan), I was not only unable to add any Christmas products to my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/arosecast" title="A Rose Cast on Etsy">Etsy store</a> (I really wanted to sell Christmas cards this year!), but didn't get around to making a little freebie to giveaway.</p>

But I still wanted to give a little something to my readers. While decorating our house for Christmas, I discovered I had a Christmas garland I made a few years ago, back when I was first doing illustration and sold digital downloads. So I thought it would be nice to give it away for free to my readers.

The look of the garland was inspired by tattoo design and Sailor Jerryâ€™s aesthetic. So hopefully they look a little different from a lot of other Christmas decorations. The Santa Claus and reindeer aren't just simple shapes, but are posable card puppets. Just grab a few brass fasteners and place them into the marked dots at the figures' joints in order to pose them.

For my own garland, I grabbed some thick white card and printed out one Santa Claus for the middle, two reindeers, robins (there are two versions of each, looking in different directions) and stars, and then as many red and yellow fairy lights required to place in between each of the larger printables. And then just added a little hook on the back of each (you can do this with card or string) and attached them to a long piece of thick string. Very simple.

It's a kind of illustration I don't do anymore (my style is much more <a href="/" title="A Rose Cast Portfolio">feminine and art nouveau influenced</a>, and I don't do digital colouring any more), but I think it's still quite cute.
