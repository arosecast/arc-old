<p class="intro">Here is a new illustration in my line of pieces devoted to Haruki Murakami novels. This time it is of Sputnik Sweetheart, a tale about one man’s search for a friend who has mysteriously disappeared while in Greece.</p>

![Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel Sputnik Sweetheart by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast](/assets/folio/murakami/illustration-murakami-sputniksweetheart.jpg "Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel Sputnik Sweetheart by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast")

The novel is largely about how we mould ourselves, losing who we truly are, in order to adapt and live in a conformist society. It’s another Murakami novel I remember loving, however as it’s been, I think, seven years since I’ve read it, a lot of the detail and its events have left my memory. I’m looking forward to rereading this novel on my chronological reread of all of Murakami’s novels.

As I've mentioned before when sharing my other [Haruki Murakami illustrations](/tag/Haruki-Murakami/ "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Novels"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So here is my new version of the illustration for Murakami’s novel, Sputnik Sweetheart. This illustration is of, unsurprisingly, the satellite Sputnik, set against a dark but enchanting spacescape (is that a word?). I think it works well as a kind of dreamy image, the star and nebula filled background softening the cold, hard edge of the metallic spacecraft.

As normal, I have released it as an A6 and A4 print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18192366 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart on Esty") store. If you go for the [A6](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267617721/haruki-murakami-watercolor-novel "A6 watercolor illustration Art Print of Haruki Murakami's novel Sputnik Sweetheart on Etsy") art print (as shown above), you can choose to add a few of my other Murkamai illustrations to the order to save a little money on each.

This illustration is also available as a range of products over on [Art Rookie](http://artrookie.co.uk/profile_items.php?designer=ARoseCast&design=9502 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart on Art Rookie"), [Redbubble](http://www.redbubble.com/people/arosecast/collections/512595-haruki-murakami-novel-illustrations "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart on Redbubble") and [Society6](https://society6.com/akai_hane/collection/haruki-murakami-novel-illustrations "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart on Society6").
