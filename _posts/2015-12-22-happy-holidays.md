<p class="intro">Just a little quick post to wish you all Happy Holidays / Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! I’ll be bedding down at home with my partner and our cats until 4th January, hopefully doing a lot of reading, watching of TV, and just relaxing properly for the first time in a very long time.</p>

On Christmas Day, we’ll be hosting Christmas dinner at our house, with two of my brothers and two of my sister-in-laws. I’ll be making a few of the dishes, but will have plenty of time to relax (and drink) thanks to the fact my brothers and partner are big into their cooking; they’ll be the ones mostly slaving over hot stoves!

I will be back in 2016 with some new products I’m really excited about (you can see some sneak peeks over on my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/arosecast). Though I will have a little January cat-themed freebie due to pop up just before the New Year.

So see you all next year!
