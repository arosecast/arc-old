<p class="intro">February was a busy month for me. Not only did I celebrate another birthday, but I was working on both new products and my first launch in a physical store.</p>

Really excited at having my products now stocked in [Studio Souk](http://www.studiosouk.com), a beautiful store in the centre of Belfast which stocks only products by creators and makers living in Northern Ireland. If you live in Northern Ireland, or have a trip planned here soon, go have a look!

So what else have I been up to this month?

Snapshots
---
+ As of March, my products are being stocked in a physical store for the first time! [Studio Souk](http://www.studiosouk.com) in the centre of Belfast. So a lot of work in February was getting prepped. Here are a few necklaces being created.
+ I turned 33 in February. As a present to myself, I went on an eight mile walk around Belfast forests and parks. This part of the River Lagan is about a three minute walk from my flat.
+ Took a little trip over to London to see my brother, sister-in-law and niece. Finally got around to visiting Daunt Books. Urgh, how perfect is this bookstore?

Other Happenings This Month
---
+ <strong>Reading</strong> // <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13486632-the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared" title="The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson on Goodreads">The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared</a>, by Jonas Jonasson. I picked this up in Daunt Books as the storyline sounds perfect for me; an old man, who has been a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century, goes off on an adventure. Such a fun book! ([Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1680658-karen-murray))
+ <strong>Watching</strong> // More Parks and Rec. I only have one season left (*cries*)
+ <strong>Listening</strong> // I've always loved listening to non-English music. Before it's largely been Japanese or Russian, but I've had Gwenno's Welsh language debut album 'Y Dydd Olaf' on repeat over the last few days. I especially love <a href="https://youtu.be/OClOH2BP4LI" title="Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki by Gwenno">'Fratolish Hiang Perpeshki'</a>
+ <strong>Playing</strong> // Back onto Bioshock after a while away. I need to play games more often. When I take a break, it takes a while to regain my coordination!
+ <strong>Eating</strong> // ALL of the healthy things! I'm trying to eat as healthy as possible to help with a wee medical issue. Also means dougnuts and other 'bad' food aren't off limits if I'm good most of the time ^_-
+ <strong>Learning</strong> // Researching how to create a few new types of products (Who likes pins?)
+ <strong>Doing</strong> // Planning our bathroom redo. Yay for hopefully soon getting rid of our 15-year-old cheap builder build bathroom suites!
