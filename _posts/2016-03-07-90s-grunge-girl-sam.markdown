I was born in 1983, so when the grunge music scene hit, I would be considered a little young to be listening to bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana and Pearl Jam. However, being a late addition to my family, and therefore growing up with three brothers who range from seven to ten years older than me, it is very much the music of my childhood.

Listening to this kind of music at the point where children first really start to become music fans meant that it was something I really connected to. Whereas the other kids I knew loved their boy bands and were starting to listen to (bad) dance music, I loved grunge, and other forms of rock, best (as well as a bit of Britpop).

That was my influence behind this illustration. That kind of 90s grunge fashion has been coming back into vogue lately; in fact on days when I don't need to dress up, I've found myself sticking to jeans, boots, t-shirts and checked shirts. So I thought why not create a new girl around that idea.

This is Sam. Living in a New York brownstone in the mid-1990s, she loves little more than listening to her favourite Seattle-based rockers. She buys her Doc Marten boots and flannel shirts in thrift stores, and owns as many band t-shirts as she can find. (But, of course, only of the bands she actually likes.) Along with the big grunge bands, such as Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots, she also loves those that helped influence the genre, from Sonic Youth and the Pixies to the Butthole Surfers.

She was a lot of fun to create, especially her pessimistic expression, and the check pattern on her shirt.

As normal, I have released Sam as an [A6](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267621317/watercolor-portrait-illustration-a6 "A6 Watercolour Illustration of 90s Grunge Girl Sam on Esty") and [A4](https://www.etsy.com/listing/271265430/sam-a4-print-of-a-pencil-watercolour "A4 Watercolour Illustration of 90s Grunge Girl Sam on Esty") print on my Etsy, as well as a range of products, from cushions and rugs, to mugs and tech covers / skins over on [Society6](https://society6.com/product/sam-a-90s-grunge-music-fan-in-a-flannel-shirt-band-t-shirt-dm-boots_print#1=45 "Watercolour Illustration of 90s Grunge Girl Sam on Society6").

I have also used the illustration on a new one of my [rose gold and wooden pendant necklaces](https://www.etsy.com/listing/271265934/rose-gold-walnut-wood-pendant-necklace), again available on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/listing/271265934/rose-gold-walnut-wood-pendant-necklace). The necklace has been hand-made by me (with the printed pendant created by [Zap! Creatives](http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk)).
