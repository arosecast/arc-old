<p class="intro">So, this has been a pretty big month for me. Not only in terms of the festive season, but also as I've <a href="/my-work/2015/12/01/welcome-to-a-rose-cast.html" title="A New Start | Welcome to A Rose Cast">relaunched my illustration and design business</a>. I've been relearning how to blog and promote my work, hopefully in a more successful way than before.</p>

So what have I been up to over the month of December, not just in terms of work, but fun as well?

Other Happenings This Month
---
+ <strong>Reading</strong> // It by Stephen King. Well, I’ve been reading it since August. It is so VERY long. Parts I’ve loved, other parts I was just feeling desperate to get to the end as my interest (and the story) waxed and waned ([Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/arosecast))
+ <strong>Watching</strong> // The Good Wife. All kinds of love for this show. I’m into season five now, but Netflix doesn’t have past this point! Please, Netflix, can we have the rest?
+ <strong>Listening</strong> // [Weezer, Thank God for Girls](https://youtu.be/t4wjekuKn-4)
+ <strong>Playing</strong> // The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I’m so bad at this kind of game. I can never figure out what I’m supposed to do! But then I’ve rarely played this type of game before, so maybe I need to train myself more?
+ <strong>Eating</strong> // ALL the Christmas goodness! Especially stuffing, ham and sprouts
+ <strong>Learning</strong> // Tying to learn how to run my new business! Baby steps ...
+ <strong>Doing</strong> // Finishing off painting our flat. Some more trim work do do ;_;
