Other Happenings This Month
---
+ <strong>Reading</strong> // The Night Circus, by Erin Morgenstern. I borrowed this book at the insistence of a friend, read it in a few days, bought my own copy, and read it again within another few days. I adore books set during this time period with supernatural elements, so really I should have read it sooner. Absolutely obsessed! ([Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1680658-karen-murray))
+ <strong>Watching</strong> // Penny Dreadful. Again, with its setting and genre, right up my street.
+ <strong>Listening</strong> // [The Staves](https://play.spotify.com/album/2VxNr0ZeGhWJ8rQNe4d8vS). Beautiful stuff.
+ <strong>Playing</strong> // Still Bioshock, but I'm almost finished!
+ <strong>Eating</strong> // Homemade satay chicken. Healthy and yummy!
+ <strong>Learning</strong> // Brushing up on my sewing skills so I can make a few nice things for our flat
+ <strong>Doing</strong> // Painting pavements for a client. Ouch, it is not pleasant.
