title: Portrait Illustrations
description: These are some of my older portrait illustrations, created while I still worked primarily as a web designer. A few were drawn in pencil and coloured digitally, whereas others marked my first steps into using watercolour. Many of these have been exhibited at the PSÂ² = Paragon Studios gallery in Belfast, and made up part of PaperGirl Belfast 2014 and 2015. The final piece was used as my submission for Culture Night Belfast 2014.
