title: Illustration | Astronomy Fan Zahrah
description: With a name meaning 'star', pink haired Zahrah has such a love for astronomy that she has had constellations and the phases of the moon tattooed onto her skin. As well as releasing this illustration as a print, I have turned it into a piece of rose gold necklace with a printed walnut wood pendant.
