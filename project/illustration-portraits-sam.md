title: Illustration | 90's Grunge Girl Sam
description: Sam is a messy haired, grunge loving girl from the early 1990s. She loves few things more than her trusty plaid flannel shirt, her Smashing Pumpkins 'Zero' t-shirt, and a pair of DMs. You can often find her sitting on a Brooklyn brownstone listening to some of her favourite Seattle-based bands.
