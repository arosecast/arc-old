title: Illustration | Nautical Meredith
description: With a name meaning 'Guardian of the Sea', Meredith is a blue haired, ocean and cupcake loving girl who likes to accessorise with anchor necklaces and striped breton tops. As well as releasing this illustration as a print, I have turned it into a piece of rose gold necklace with a printed walnut wood pendant.
