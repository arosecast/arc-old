title: Illustration | Wild Sofa Beasts
description: I adore cats (and pretty much any other animal), and I wanted to do a little project where they are the focus. Wild Sofa Beasts is a range of illustration products all about cats. So far I have used my own three felines as the inspiration for the pieces.
