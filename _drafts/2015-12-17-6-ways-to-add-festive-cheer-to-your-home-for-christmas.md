<p class="intro">Sure, any time before the 25th December is not too late to add new little bits of festive decor, no?</p>

This is especially true if it’s something that will prove fun to create yourself (even better if it you can turn it into a project to share with your friends and/or family). Over the past few weeks I’ve seen so many wonderful Christmas DIYs and simple decorating ideas, that I thought I’d create a little list of those I love the most.

And if you like these DIYs, you'll maybe like the <a href="/freebie/2015/12/10/printable-tattoo-inspired-christmas-garland.md" title="Free Printable Christmas Garland">free tattoo-inspired printable Christmas garland</a> (complete with Santa, reindeers, fairy lights, robins and stars) I posted last week.

		<p>If you like a minimal rather than an over-the-top, bling-filled Christmas, you should try this idea; a mostly undecorated fir tree with a burst of gold stars arising from part way up and onto the wall, with a simple natural coloured hessian (also know as Jute or Burlap) skirt.</p>

		<p>If you’re not a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas decor, you can follow this DIY from the always colourful A Beautiful Mess and hand-paint some cute eyes onto pastel baubles. Very modern and hip.</p>

		<p>Another for those that like their homes festive but simple and sophisticated. This decorated room has a very sedate, Scandinavian theme, with gold details set against dark grey and white walls. Simple bunting and warm, soft blankets are really the order of the day. I especially love the branch adorned with copious amounts of hanging baubles, something that can be recreated very easily and cheaply.</p>

		<p>I love those adorable little villages you always see around this time of year, usually illuminated from behind with some fairy lights. This tutorial is in French, but I think it’s all pretty self-explanatory, and it comes with a wonderful <a href="http://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2014/12/07/villagelumineux/villagelumineux.pdf" title="">free printable</a>. I also adore the way <a href="http://thehousethatlarsbuilt.com" title="The House that Lars Built Website">The House that Lars Built</a> has decorated their <a href="http://thehousethatlarsbuilt.com/2015/12/diy-gingerbread-house-gift-boxes.html/" title="DIY Gingerbread House Gift Boxes from The House that Lars Built">gingerbread house gift boxes</a> with beautiful white illustrations. This year I've combined these two DIYs to create <a href="LINK TO INSTAGRAM POST" title="My illuminated Christmas village on Instagram">my own wee village</a>.

		<h2>5. <a href="http://www.theholidaycollective.com/diy-paper-christmas-trees/" title="How to create your own DIY Paper Christmas Trees">DIY Paper Christmas Trees</a></h2>
		<p>These paper Christmas trees are very cute. Not only do I love this DIY as it's easy and incredibly effective, but it's also customisable; you can make trees of any size, and by using the wrapping paper of your choice you can match them to your other Christmas decorations. And if, like me, you are limited in terms of where to store your festive bits and pieces after Christmas, you can collapse the trees and store them flat.</p>

		<p>In this day and age, your physical space isn’t the only place that could do with a little festive decoration. These simple (and free) patterned phone and desktop wallpapers from <a href="http://www.piperwinston.com" title="Piper Winston Website">Piper Winston</a> are a great way to bring something season to your digital devices. You have four to choose from; acorns, red snow, fir tree branches with red berries, or stars. Or, like me, you can set your computer to rotate your wallpapers in order to use all four.</p>
