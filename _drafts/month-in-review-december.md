<p class="intro">So, this has been a pretty big month. Not only in terms of the festive season, but I also <a href="/my-work/2015/12/01/welcome-to-a-rose-cast.html" title="A New Start | Welcome to A Rose Cast">relaunched my illustration and design business</a>. Which means I've been relearning how to do everything, but better than the first time around many years back.</p>

Other Happenings This Month
---
+ <strong>Reading</strong> // It by Stephen King. Well, I’ve been reading it since August. It is so VERY long. Parts I’m loving, other parts I’m just feeling desperate to get to the end as my interest (and the story) waxes and wanes ([Follow me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1680658-karen-murray))
+ <strong>Watching</strong> // The Good Wife. All kinds of love for this show. I’m into season five now, but Netflix doesn’t have past this point! Please, Netflix, can we have the next two seasons?
+ <strong>Listening</strong> // [Weezer, Thank God for Girls](https://youtu.be/t4wjekuKn-4)
+ <strong>Playing</strong> // The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I’m so bad at this kind of game. I can never figure out what I’m supposed to do! But then I’ve rarely played this type of game before, so maybe I need to train myself
+ <strong>Eating</strong> // ALL the Christmas goodness! Especially stuffing, ham and sprouts
+ <strong>Learning</strong> // Tying to learn how to run my new business! Baby steps ...
+ <strong>Doing</strong> // Finishing off painting our flat. Some more trim work do do ;_;
