<p class="intro">Here we have my new illustration for Haruki Murakami's South of the Border, West of the Sun, a novel about an outwardily lucky man who feels there is still something missing in his seemingly perfect life.</p>

This is another one of Murakami’s realistic novels, which I tend to prefer less to his metaphysical books, but I remember really connecting with it. I think partially as it’s nice and short and therefore felt very satisfying, finishing it in a few hours. I also think at the time the idea behind the novel really spoke to me; we can have everything that society tells us will make us happy (family, possessions, wealth), but still feel empty within. I think that’s a very common emotion, but we are taught that there is something shameful in it, and that it’s a feeling to which we shouldn’t admit.

As I've mentioned before when sharing my other [Haruki Murakami illustrations](/tag/Haruki-Murakami/ "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Novels"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So here is my new version of the illustration for Murakami’s novel, South of the Border, West of the Sun. This illustration refers to the music Hajime and Shimamoto listened to together as children, one of many things that connected these two lonely souls.

As normal, I have released it as an A6 and A4 print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18192366 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's South of the Border, West of the Sun on Esty") store, as well as a range of products over on [Society6](LINK "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's South of the Border, West of the Sun on Esty").
