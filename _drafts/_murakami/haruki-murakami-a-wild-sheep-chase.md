<p class="intro">And here we have another one of my Haruki Murakami illustrations, this time of A Wild Sheep Chase, a mock-detective novel and the third book of the Trilogy of the Rat.</p>

![Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel A Wild Sheep Chase by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast](/assets/folio/murakami/illustration-murakami-awildsheepchase.jpg "Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel A Wild Sheep Chase by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast")

I found this novel a lot of fun. It’s a real adventure novel about a man on the search for a sheep. Yes, sounds very strange, but it’s definitely worth a read. I loved how unusual and playful the book is, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys metaphysical literature.

[Dance Dance Dance](LINK "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Dance Dance Dance") is a kind of sequel to this novel, as it follows the same unnamed, apathetic protagonist, but they can be read separately (though it is another wonderful tale, so definitely try it out as well). Over the next little while, I’ll be releasing illustrations from the other two books of the Trilogy of the Rat, Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973.

As I've mentioned before when sharing my other [Haruki Murakami illustrations](/tag/Haruki-Murakami/ "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Novels"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So here is my new version of the illustration for Murakami’s novel, A Wild Sheep Chase. I’m really chuffed with how this sheep turned out. I don’t think there was a better image for the illustration, as the whole book revolves around a search for an unusual sheep. The combination of the vivid green grass and bright red star really make this piece jump from the page.

As normal, I have released it as an A6 and A4 print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18192366 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's A Wild Sheep Chase on Esty") store, as well as a range of products over on [Society6](LINK "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's A Wild Sheep Chase on Esty").
