<p class="intro">Well, that’s the holidays over for another year. By now most of us are back at work. The days are still horribly short and weather is getting a bit colder.</p>

To top off all these normal new year woes, on my first day back to work (literally at 9am), I slipped on some wet, tiled stairs and now have a lovely set of bright bruises all down my left side! Blurgh!

I think we all need a little pick me up to get over the January blues. So I’m sharing a few New Year / January 2016 downloadable freebies to cheer us all up.

		<p>I love the sophistication of Cocorrina's free downloadable 2016 monthly calendar. Beautiful rough, hand-written month titles created in black marker pen, with gold 2016 stamps, and a simple clean calendar below. Great for a printable as it won’t use too much ink.</p>

		<p>If I don’t plan things out, I find it hard to figure out what I’m supposed to be doing on a day-to-day basis. With all the hopes and resolutions that come with the new year, it’s the perfect time for a lovely and pretty planner. With lovely calligraphy titles and plenty of room for your plans, these two downloadable printables - a weekly and a monthly planner - are free over on the Small Paper Things blog.</p>

		<p>A little bit of encouragement always helps if you're feeling a bit burnt out or overwhelmed, common emotions when January comes along. This wallpaper, with a number of inspiring short quotes, is not only bright and cheeful, but reminds us that we can do what we set our minds to in the new year.</p>

		<p>I only know one or two people who still routinely send out thank you cards; I know it’s never been something I’ve done, normally saying thank you at the time when receiving a present, or sending the person a text message. But it is a nice tradition, and a lovely way spread some cheer in a physical way. Although originally created for Thanksgiving, the cuteness of this free downloadable card, by Teela of Every Tuesday, is a great excuse to send some caring snail mail.</p>

		<p>And if cats are your thing, you can download my freebie for January. Illustrated in watercolour, and based around my own three cats, these pattern digital wallpapers are fun and cute, with their celebration-themed elements of honeycomb paper decorations, party poppers and buckets of popcorn. They also hint at two of January's 'Holidays', Hat Day and Popcorn Day!</p>
