<p class="intro">I love to create my own <a href="" title="Buy fanart illustrations created by A Rose Cast">geeky fanart pieces</a>, and also love to buy those produced by other artists and illustrators like myself. Here are some of my favourite little nerdy creations.</p>

		<h2>1. <a href="https://society6.com/product/bubblegum-nfu_print#1=45" title="Buy this Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time blowing a bubble illustration by Little Thunder on Society6">Princess Bubblegum</a></h2>
		<p>Adventure Time's currently one of my favourite shows, and I in particular love Princess Bubblegum (I've even <a href="" title="Buy a Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time illustration by A Rose Cast">drawn her myself</a>), so it's no surprise that I adore this illustration by Little Thunder. There's also a great one of <a href="https://society6.com/product/fionna-y7x_print#1=45" title="Buy a Fionna from Adventure Time illustration by Little Thunder on Society6">Fionna</a>!</p>

		<h2>2. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/244750220/bill-murray-enamel-pin-solo-edition">Steve Zissou Pin</a></h2>
		<p>Not only has illustrator Amy Blue created this great Steve Zissou / Bill Murray pin (from Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic), but has other pins, prints and stickers up for sale from the likes of The Addams Family, Cry Baby and many other pop culture favourites.</p>

		<h2>3. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/172292042/geronimo-signed-art-print-8x10" title="Buy this Doctor Who, with Amy Pond, Rory Williams and River Song, illustration by Megan Lara">Doctor Who</a></h2>
		<p>One of many, many reasons I love Megan Lara's work is as it combines two of my favourite things; nerdiness and art nouveau. She is probably one of the most prolific fanart illustrators, with her work being used on offical projects, such as the Buffy comic. Her Cowboy Bebop t-shirt is one of my favourite pieces of clothing.</p>

		<h2>4. <a href="http://www.frannerd.cl">Sailor Moon - Update link</a></h2>
		<p>Frannerd art is just far too adorable. I have this Sailor Moon illustration on my work desk, and it really perks up my work area. If you haven't watched them yet, please go and check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/frannerd13">her videos</a>; they are a lot of fun.</p>

		<h2>5. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/187411760/parks-recreation-brooch-lil-sebastian" title="Buy Kate Rowland's Parks &amp; Recreation 'Lil' Sebastian' Wooden Brooch">Lil' Sebastian</a></h2>
		<p>I love Parks &amp; Recs; it has to be one of the funniest shows of the past decade and Leslie Knope is one of my TV heroes. Kate Rowland makes lovely wooden pieces of jewellery, and many of these are dedicated to her favourite shows, including this wonderful Lil' Sebastian brooch. Check out her store for pieces from Twin Peaks, Arrested Development and others.</p>

		<h2>6. <a href="http://shopkategabrielle.com/collections/brooches/products/clever-girl-brooch" title="Jurassic Park 'Clever Girl' black and white acrylic brooch, laser cut from Kate Gabrielle's original drawing">Jurassic Park</a></h2>
		<p>I'm not even a fan of Jurassic Park or dinosaurs, but I love this brooch. It would be hard to mention all the series and movies Kate Gabrielle has created pieces for. From The Office and 30 Rock, to Jurassic Park and The X Files, I would be surprised if anyone couldn't find something from one of their favourites here.</p>
