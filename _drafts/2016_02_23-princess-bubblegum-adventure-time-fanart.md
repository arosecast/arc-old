<p class="intro">I adore Adventure Time. I've always been a fan of animated shows, and this one has captured my heart lately. It's both mind-boggling and funny, while having a bittersweet and thought side to it.</p>

Undoubtedly one of the best characters is Princess Bubblegum. She’s incredibly moral and tirelessly devoted to her people, but still quite snarky and has a tendency to look down on people who don’t match up to her fierce intelligence. And she has amazing pink hair. So I thought she would be the perfect subject for a new little piece of fan art.

Like my [Sailor Moon](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208694619/fan-art-tsukino-usagi-sailor-moon-a4) piece, it was fun to recreate an animated character in my own style. Unlike characters that I’ve done before from live-action TV, with these kinds of pieces I’m not limited to drawing the face of a real life person, so have a bit more artistic freedom in how to depict them.

She is available on my [Etsy](LINK "Watercolour Illustration of Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time on Esty") store as an [A4](LINK "A4 Watercolour Illustration Print of Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time on Esty") and an [A6](LINK "A6 Watercolour Illustration Print of Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time on Esty") art print on thick silk card, as well as a range of products over on [Society6](LINK "Watercolour Illustration of Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time on Society6").

I’m hoping to eventually turn her into a [greeting card](https://www.etsy.com/listing/213514369/fan-art-greeting-cards-select-who-you) with additional text, as I’ve done before with [Captain Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation](https://www.etsy.com//listing/211433813/fan-art-captain-jean-luc-picard-of-the), [Mal from Firefly](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209540430/fan-art-malcolm-mal-reynolds-of-joss), [Willow from Buffy The Vampire Slayer](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210512307/fan-art-willow-rosenberg-of-joss-whedons) and [Sailor Moon](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208694619/fan-art-tsukino-usagi-sailor-moon-a4). So keep an eye out for that. Now to figure out what her card should say &hellip;
