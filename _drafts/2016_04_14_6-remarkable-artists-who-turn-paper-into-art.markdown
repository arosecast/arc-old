<p class="intro">Recently there seems to have been a real explosion of illustration and art created using paper. These intricate, multilayered art works are a real feat of effort, the creators turning often delicate hand-cut pieces of paper into full three-dimensional dioramas or flatlay designs.</p>

Here are a few paper cut artists who have captured my eye lately.
