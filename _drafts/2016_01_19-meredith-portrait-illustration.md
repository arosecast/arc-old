I've a new one of my girls finished off and up on my stores. This blue-haired woman is Meredith. With a name meaning 'Guardian of the Sea', she is an ocean and cupcake loving girl who likes to accessorise with anchor necklaces and striped breton tops.

Like most of my pieces, I have Meredith up as an [A4](LINK) and [A6 / postcard](LINK) print (see above) over on my Etsy store. Both are printed digitally on gorgeous soft silk paper (love the texture of this stuff); the A4s have a weight of 250gsm, whereas the A6 are of 300gsm, giving a nice thickness to each print. And I've used her on a whole range of items on my [Society6](LINK) store; pillows, phone covers, mugs, you name it, she's on them.

Just like my previous girl, [Zahrah](/my-work/2015/12/08/zahrah-portrait-illustration.html "Pink-Haired Astronomy Lover Zahrah"), also turned her into a piece of jewellery! Using a chain and fastenings in a rose gold colour, teamed with a printed walnut wood pendant (produced by [Zap! Creatives](http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk)</a>), I hand-made these necklaces. I even joined a little light green bead to each to add a little more sparkle to the piece (I think it brings out the green of her dress). After years of making a few pieces of jewellery for myself and friends, it's nice to create something adorned with my own artwork.
