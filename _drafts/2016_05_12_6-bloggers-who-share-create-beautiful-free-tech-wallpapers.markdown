<p class="intro">I always like to keep a good stack of creative and colourful wallpapers loaded on my laptop, iPad and phone. I spend so much time on my tech devices for work that it’s always good to have something pretty on hand to look at while navigating between a dozen different programs.</p>
I have a number of go-to sites where I can always count on getting something new every week or month, and I thought I should share a few of them with you. If you need more, check out my [Freebies // Dress Your Tech Pinterest board](https://uk.pinterest.com/arosecast/freebies-dress-your-tech/ "My Freebies // Dress Your Tech Pinterest board").
