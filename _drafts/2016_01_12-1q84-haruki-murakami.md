<p class="intro">Another month, another one of my Haruki Murakami illustrations. This time it is of 1Q84, one of Murakami's many surreal novels.</p>

![Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84 by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast](/assets/folio/murakami/illustration-murakami-19q4.jpg "Watercolor illustration of Haruki Murakami's novel 1Q84 by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast")

1Q84 is Murakami's longest novel, originally released as three separate volumes. I tend to prefer his more surreal, so it was a delight for me to read, even though it did take me a fair amount of time to get through its almost 1000 pages.

As I mentioned last month, when I shared my illustration for [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](/my-work/2015/12/15/colorless-tsukuru-haruki-murakami.html "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage"), a few years ago I decided to do an [illustration for each of Haruki Murakami's novels](http://www.akaihane.co.uk/post/54588755092/haruki-murakami "The original Haruki Murakami novel illustrations") in order to practice. Each was hand drawn in pencil and coloured digitally in Photoshop. I was surprised by how popular they became, and had many people asking if any of them were for sale as prints. But I wasn’t quite happy enough with them to have them printed; I was at a point where I was still deep into training and hadn’t yet developed a style I was settled on.

Two and a half years went by. I was now working full time as an illustrator and designer, my skills had developed fourfold, and I had a look and feel I was delighted with. So I felt that maybe it was time to recreate the whole project and finally allow fellow Murakami fans to purchase them as prints and other products.

So here is my new version of the illustration for Murakami’s novel, 1Q84. As normal, I have released it as an A6 and A4 print on my [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?section_id=18192366 "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 on Esty") store, as well as a range of products over on [Society6](LINK "Watercolour Illustration for Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 on Esty").

You can also get a sneak peek at all the rest of my <a href="/project/illustration-murakami.html" title="Haruki Murakami novel watercolor illustrations by illustrator / artist Karen Muray of A Rose Cast">Haruki Murakami novel illustrations</a> over on my portfolio. For now, Colorless Tsukuru is the only one available to purchase, but I'll be adding a new one every month to my online stores.
