I've started doing a few flashbacks posts talking about some of my favourite pieces from my back-catalogue; first up was my fan art illustration of [Willow Rosenberg](LINK) from Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Today, it's all about another fan art piece, this time of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, from sci-fi epic Star Trek: The Next Generation.

I'm a big nerd; you can see that from [a number of](http://127.0.0.1:4000/wish-list/2016/04/21/6-adorable-brooches-pins-from-independent-makers.html "Wish List // 6 Adorable Brooches and Pins from Independent Makers") my [wish list posts](/wish-list/2016/02/25/6-nerdy-creations-by-independent-artists.html "Wish List // 6 Nerdy Creations by Independent Artists"). And my all-time favourite show as a child was Star Trek: The Next Generation.

Captain Jean-Luc Picard was an idol to me as a child (well, still is), and I think a lot of my moral basis comes directly from him. (As well as Hawkeye from M&lowast;A&lowast;S&lowast;H, another childhood fave of mine. Yeah ... I had weird choices for a kid.) So I wanted to create a little ode to him while I was trying my hand at drawing from real-life references. And just like [Willow](LINK), I was really ecstatic with how he turned out.

So I decided to pop [A4](https://www.etsy.com/listing/211433813/fan-art-captain-jean-luc-picard-of-the "A4 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, from sci-fi epic Star Trek: The Next Generation, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") and [A6](https://www.etsy.com/listing/267723374/fan-art-postcards-choose-from-picard "A6 art print of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, from sci-fi epic Star Trek: The Next Generation, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;") art prints up on my [Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast), along with a [greeting card version with an additional banner of text](https://www.etsy.com/listing/213514369/fan-art-greeting-cards-select-who-you "Greeting Card of Watercolour Fan Art Illustration of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, from sci-fi epic Star Trek: The Next Generation, with text &quot;I'll always be your sidekick&quot;"). I've always liked the sound of the Walt Whitman/Dead Poets Society quote, &quot;O Captain! My Captain!&quot;, so thought it would be fitting for this piece. It makes for a great greeting card to give to a nerdy friend.

I currently have [five fan art illustrations in this line of art prints and greeting cards](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=16232976). Captain Picard is joined by; Joss Whedon creations [Malcolm ‘Mal’ Reynolds](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209540430/fan-art-malcolm-mal-reynolds-of-joss) from the short-lived sci-fi/western classic Firefly, and [Willow Rosenberg](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210512307/fan-art-willow-rosenberg-of-joss-whedons) from Buffy The Vampire Slayer; Usagi Tsukino from the manga/anime [Sailor Moon](https://www.etsy.com/listing/208694619/fan-art-tsukino-usagi-sailor-moon-a4); and [Princess Bubblegum](https://www.etsy.com/listing/257921802/fan-art-princess-bubblegum-from) from the animated show Adventure Time (though she still needs the greeting card treatment).
