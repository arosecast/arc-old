I've started doing a few flashbacks posts talking about some of my favourite pieces from my back-catalogue; first up was my fan art illustration of [Willow Rosenberg](LINK) from Joss Whedon's Buffy The Vampire Slayer; then [Captain Jean-Luc Picard](LINK) from Star Trek: The Next Generation. And lastly I shared [Malcolm 'Mal' Reynolds](LINK) of classic sci-fi/western Firefly. Today, it's all about another fan art piece, this time of Usagi Tuskino from the manga/anime Sailor Moon.

I'm a big nerd; you can see that from [a number of](http://127.0.0.1:4000/wish-list/2016/04/21/6-adorable-brooches-pins-from-independent-makers.html "Wish List // 6 Adorable Brooches and Pins from Independent Makers") my [wish list posts](/wish-list/2016/02/25/6-nerdy-creations-by-independent-artists.html "Wish List // 6 Nerdy Creations by Independent Artists").

I currently have [five fan art illustrations in this line of art prints and greeting cards](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ARoseCast?ref=hdr_shop_menu&section_id=16232976). Sailor Moon is joined by; Joss Whedon creations [Malcolm ‘Mal’ Reynolds](https://www.etsy.com/listing/209540430/fan-art-malcolm-mal-reynolds-of-joss) from the short-lived sci-fi/western classic Firefly, and [Willow Rosenberg](https://www.etsy.com/listing/210512307/fan-art-willow-rosenberg-of-joss-whedons) from Buffy The Vampire Slayer; [Captain Picard](https://www.etsy.com/listing/211433813/fan-art-captain-jean-luc-picard-of-the) from sci-fi epic Star Trek: The Next Generation; and [Princess Bubblegum](https://www.etsy.com/listing/257921802/fan-art-princess-bubblegum-from) from the animated show Adventure Time (though she still needs the greeting card treatment).
