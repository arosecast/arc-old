<p class="intro">My partner and I have never really celebrated Valentine's much. His birthday is just over two weeks before it, my birthday is THREE days before, and our anniversary takes place a month after.</p>

But I've seen so many fun and creative DIYs and freebies floating around lately that I though more than a few of them are worth doing.
