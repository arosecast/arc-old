<p class="intro">Sure, any time before the 25th December is not too late to add new little bits of festive decor, no?</p>

This is especially true if it’s something that will prove fun to create yourself (even better if it you can turn it into a project to share with your friends and/or family). Over the past few weeks I’ve seen so many wonderful Christmas DIYs and simple decorating ideas, that I thought I’d create a little list of those I love the most (a few of which I’ve been trying myself).

		<h2>1. <a href="http://www.ohhhmhhh.de/das-stern-spektakel-in-neonpink-und-kupfer-der-knuller/" title="">Simple Stary Tree Decoration</a></h2>
		<p>If you like a minimal rather than an over-the-top, bling-filled Christmas, you should try this idea; a mostly undecorated fir tree with a burst of gold stars arising from part way up and onto the wall, with a simple natural coloured hessian (also know as Jute or Burlap) skirt.</p>

		<h2>2. <a href="http://www.abeautifulmess.com/2015/11/eye-ornament-diy.html" title="">DIY Eye Ornament from A Beautiful Mess</a></h2>
		<p>If you’re not a traditionalist when it comes to Christmas decor, you can follow this DIY from the always colourful A Beautiful Mess and hand-paint some cute eyes onto pastel baubles. Very modern and hip.</p>

		<h2>3. <a href="http://www.houseofvalentina.com/natural-glamorous-christmas-room/" title="">A Natural &amp; Glamorous Christmas Room</a></h2>
		<p>Another for those that like their homes festive but simple and sophisticated. This decorated room has a very sedate, Scandinavian theme, with gold details set against dark grey and white walls. Simple bunting and warm, soft blankets are really the order of the day. I especially love the branch adorned with copious amounts of hanging baubles.</p>

		<h2>4. <a href="http://aux-petites-merveilles.blogspot.se/2014/12/diy-village-lumineux-de-noel.html" title="">DIY Illuminated Christmas Village Scene</a></h2>
		<p>I love those adorable little villages you always see around this time of year, usually illuminated from behind with some fairy lights. So this year I have made once for our living room, and the results turned out so darn well (link to instagram photo). This tutorial is in French, but it comes with a wonderful <a href="http://www.fichier-pdf.fr/2014/12/07/villagelumineux/villagelumineux.pdf" title="">free printable</a>, and I think it’s all pretty self-explanator.y</p>

		<p>In this day and age, your physical space isn’t the only place that could do with a little festive decoration. These simple (and free) patterned phone and desktop wallpapers from <a href="http://www.piperwinston.com" title="">Piper Winston</a> are a great way to bring something season to your digital devices. You have four to choose from; acorns, red snow, fir tree branches with red berries, or stars. Or, like me, you can set your computer to rotate your wallpapers in order to use all four.</p>
