	  <p>I'm Karen, the person behind <strong><em>A Rose Cast</em></strong>. I find inspiration in ethereal tales, all things whimsical, and geek culture. With pencils and watercolour, I bring these influences into my work to create pieces with a feminine and quirky art nouveau aesthetic. Sometimes this means portraiture of beautiful women with an abundance of piercings and/or tattoos, and unnatural coloured hair. Other times it's fun doodles dedicated to my favourite TV shows, movies and books.</p>

<h2>A Little More About Me</h2>
<p>I live in Belfast, Northern Ireland (but don’t worry; I work with people worldwide. Thank you, internet!) with my partner and our three cats, <a href="/project/illustration-wild-sofa-beasts.html">Mog, Toby and Monty</a>. I find myself drawn to the <a href="/project/illustration-fanart.html">quirky and nerdy</a>, love clothing (but not always what’s in fashion), and music sung from the soul. If I could have a special power I'd want to be able to read faster (I buy books quicker than I can complete them), rather than something more superhero-y.</p>
<p>I'm a wanderer, and love to venture through forests and old cities, always staring above eye-level to find those hidden gems we miss in everyday life (and often aiming my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arosecast/">camera at old buildings</a>).</p>

<p>I prefer my liquid sustenance in whiskey or milkshake form.</p>

<h2>Promoting Other Creatives</h2>
<p>I adore talking about other artists, illustrators and small independent businesses; I know how difficult it can be to run a small, creative business. My blog is dedicated to promoting other people like myself, from fellow creatives selling their own products to bloggers giving out advice or creating fun DIY projects. It is also where I often talk about my own work, and give away freebies such as wallpapers for digital devices.</p>
